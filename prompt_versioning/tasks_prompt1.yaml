    and formatting:

      include 3–5 relevant hashtags. No paragraphs.
    - LinkedIn posts → under 300 characters, professional and insightful, 
      use short paragraphs or line breaks. Minimal hashtags (1–2).
    - Facebook posts → 50–80 characters, conversational, slightly casual. 
      Can include a question to boost engagement. 
    - Twitter (X) posts/threads → 170–280 characters max per post, 
      witty or concise, include 1–3 hashtags sparingly. 
    - TikTok captions → short (50–100 characters), fun or trendy tone, 
      2–4 hashtags max. 
    - Blog articles → long-form (500+ words), structured with headings, 
      subheadings, and paragraphs. No hard character limits.

  seo_optimizer_task:
  description: >
    Take the draft content from the Content Writer Agent and optimize it 
    for SEO when appropriate. The optimization rules depend on {content_type}:

    - Blog → Full SEO optimization: integrate keywords naturally, add meta 
      description, title tag, URL slug, and use structured headings (H1, H2).
    - LinkedIn posts → Light optimization: improve keyword placement and flow, 
      suggest a professional title, keep it short (under 300 characters).
    - Instagram, TikTok, Facebook captions → DO NOT add meta tags, slugs, or 
      headings. Keep captions short and natural; only refine hashtags for discoverability.
    - Twitter/X posts → No meta optimization. Only adjust wording to increase 
      clarity and engagement while keeping character count below 280.

  expected_output: >
    - Optimized draft tailored to {content_type}.
    - Blogs and LinkedIn posts include SEO metadata (title, meta description, slug).
    - Social media captions (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, Twitter) remain short 
      and natural, only improved with hashtags if relevant.
